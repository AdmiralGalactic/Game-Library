# Video Games
This CSV created with Google Sheets is my personal collection of all video games that I own across all platforms. It is simply demonstrating my ability to create a spreadsheet. 
Some of the different skills represented include:
- pivot tables
- conditional formatting
- VLOOKUP
- COUNTIF and COUNTIFS
